Data Model:
Going with data model where tweet is dependent on user
/    User:
/		id
/		name
/		email address
/		following []
/		followers []

/	Tweet:
/		id 
/		content
/		date
/		creator -> foreign key to user
/		likes -> [] array of foreign keys to users

Now the "all posts" page 
	Needs to have a form for creating posts
	/	Need to create a new form in forms.py
	/	Need to send that form to the view
		Do I need a PUT request in the form's front end?
		
		In planning for this, I think I need to do a fetch request in the javascript to post the message
			that way I can call more javascript afterwards
			to update the page

	Needs to display all posts by all users
