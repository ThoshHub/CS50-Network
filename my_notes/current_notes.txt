Data Model:
Going with data model where tweet is dependent on user
/    User:
/		id
/		name
/		email address
/		following []
/		followers []

/	Tweet:
/		id 
/		content
/		date
/		creator -> foreign key to user
/		likes -> [] array of foreign keys to users

Now the "all posts" page 
	Needs to have a form for creating posts
	/	Need to create a new form in forms.py
	/	Need to send that form to the view
	/	Do I need a PUT request in the form's front end?
	/		NO
		
	/	In planning for this, I think I need to do a fetch request in the javascript to post the message
	/		that way I can call more javascript afterwards
	/		to update the page
	/ UPDATE: instead chose to just use the method provided by django to make a post request from the html page directly
	/ This forces a page refresh, but that's okay

	Needs to display all posts by all users
	Need to make an api url that returns json of Xth ten messages
	
	on page load need to send a get request to server url
	that url has to return a json of message objects (first 10 and then also a "1" to keep track of first 10)
		then when the user presses next, 10 more objects are sent ""
