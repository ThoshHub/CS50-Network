/For listings page:
/	No need to use Flexbox atm, maybe just get basic functionality working first and then
/	try to make it look better/add extra functionality later
/
/	Down the road, after basic functionality is done, might want to change the layout
/	of this part, it kinda looks bad.

/play with 
/	choices=tuple([(None, '')] + list(CATEGORY_CHOICES.CATEGORY_CHOICES)),
/	vs
/	(None, None) for category choices
/	and select which one is better/add
/
/	add required=False to fields in form that are not required

/On listing details and details page, Category has to be 'None' for Listings without a category chosen when created

/Need to add validation for bids (has to be greater than previous bid)

/Need to validate the create listings page
/	Need to make sure it cant be accessed when not logged in
/	the link shouldnt exist in the layout
/	and the actual url redirect in the views should also check if the user is logged in
/		if not boot them back to login screen with message


/Behavior:
/	For each user I need a "my listings" page
/		will redirect to login with error message at the top if not logged in
/		users will be redirected to this page after logging in
/	For each user I need a "my bids" page
/		will redirect to login with error message at the top if not logged in

/Need To do the TODO Validations

/- For the users, there also needs to be a watchlist which is just and id to a listings
/	- there should be a 

Need to edit the current listing details page which looks terrible
/	remove listing Id
/	add margins
/	add CSS
/	port it over to the listing details page <---- DO THIS WHEN YOU WAKE UP

Need to make it so user with current bid can't bid again!

Optional at the end after everything else is done:
	success messages upon 
		posting a bid
		posting a comment
		adding to and removing a watchlist
